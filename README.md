## Dynamic Polymer Annotated Library (DPAL)
DPAL is an annotated library of peer-reviewed research that aims to: (1) Fill a
knowledge gap in the materials science field (2) Re-design a common medical
field practice (the systematic literature search) to be more applicable and
universal to materials design questions.
